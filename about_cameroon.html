        <tr><td>

    <p> Cameroon (/ˌkæməˈruːn/ (About this soundlisten); French: Cameroun), officially the Republic of Cameroon (French: République du Cameroun), is a country in 
    Central Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west and north; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; and Equatorial Guinea, 
    Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Biafra, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. 
    Although Cameroon is not an ECOWAS member state, it is geographically and historically in West Africa with the Southern Cameroons which now form her 
    Northwest and Southwest Regions having a strong West African history. The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as 
    Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa. Cameroon is home to over 250 native languages spoken 
    by nearly 20 million people.Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the 
    southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), 
    which became Cameroon in English. Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west 
    and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.
