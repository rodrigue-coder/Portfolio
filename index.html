                <p> Cameroon (/ˌkæməˈruːn/ (About this soundlisten); French: Cameroun), officially the Republic of Cameroon (French: République du Cameroun), 
            is a country in Central Africa. It is bordered by Nigeria to the west and north; Chad to the northeast; the Central African Republic to the east; 
            and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the Bight of Biafra, part of the Gulf of 
            Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. Although Cameroon is not an ECOWAS member state, it is geographically and historically in West Africa with the 
            Southern Cameroons which now form her Northwest and Southwest Regions having a strong West African history. The country is sometimes identified as ù
            West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa. Cameroon is home to 
            over 250 native languages spoken by nearly 20 million people. Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as Kamerun.      <tr><td>

      <p> Yaounde, spread over 7 hills, is the capital city of Cameroon. It is in the southern part of the country. 
            The 20th-century Notre Dame des Victoires cathedral has a striking triangular roof. Nearby, in the Lake Quarter, 
            the former presidential palace is home to the National Museum, with cultural exhibits such as masks and sculptures. 
            Farther west, Mvog-Betsi Zoo is home to primates rescued from the bushmeat trade.

        <p> Victoria was founded by the British missionary Alfred Saker of the Baptist Missionary Society of London in June 1858. 
    Victoria to this treaty, initially Victoria and its vicinity was not part of the new German colony Kamerun and remained under British administration. 
    On May 7, 1886 Great Britain and Germany agreed to exchange Victoria and its vicinity for German rights at the Forcados River in Nigeria and St. Lucia, 
    KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. On March 28, 1887 Victoria and its vicinity were handed over to the German administration.  
    At the same time Swiss Presbyterian missionaries bought the land from the Baptist Missionary Society in 1887. Victoria became British again in 1915. 
    In 1982 Victoria was renamed "Limbe" by Ahmadou Ahidjo. Limbe was recently acknowledged by the Cameroonian government for its role played in the trade 
    of slaves. The current site (Bimbia) is being restored for tourists, who would like to understand how slaves made their way from far distances to the 
    coastal city.

            <tr><td>       
            <p> Buea, originally spelled "Gbea", was founded by a hunter who came from the Bomboko area. Coming from the Bomboko side of the mountain, 
            he named the new-found land in amazement as "Ebe'eya", meaning literally a "place of happenings". A prominent King of the Bakweri 
            (whose headquarters is Buea) was chief Kuva Likenye, whose clashes with German troops during the Bakweri resistance remain popular folklore; 
            currently ruled by the Endeleys. Tea growing is an important local industry, especially in Tole. Buea was the colonial capital of German 
            Kamerun from 1901 to 1919, the capital of the Southern Cameroons from 1949 until 1961 and the capital of West Cameroon until 1972, 
            when Ahmadou Ahidjo abolished the Federation of Cameroon. The German colonial administration in Buea was temporarily suspended during 
            the eruption of Mount Cameroon from 28 April until June 1909. Originally, Buea's population consisted mainly of the Bakweri people. 
            However, owing to its status as a university town and the regional capital, there are significant numbers of other ethnic groups.

        <tr><td>  
            <p>Le chute de la Mouankeu  est située dans la ville de Bafang. Elle fait une hauteur d'une quarantaine de mètres. Cette chute traîne une longue histoire liée aux cultures des peuples du « Haut-Nkam » et fait l’objet de nombreux mythes et légendes pour la plupart réels 
            et encore pratiqués de nos jours. C’est un lieu de recueillement des autochtones et dignitaires des villages alentour qui y viennent se concerter afin de 
            trouver des solutions aux problèmes qui minent ou surviennent dans leur communauté (succession lors du décès d’un chef ou dignitaire, partage de terres/héritages…).            
            La chute de la Mouankeu est alimentée par deux cours d’eaux qui se joignent et se déversent dans un ravin long de plus d’une quarantaine de mètres. 
            Elle fait environ 40 mètres de haut et ressemble en miniature aux chutes d’Ekom Nkam.
